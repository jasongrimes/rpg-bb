Playground site TODOs
=====================

Client
------

* Add a loading animation when searching and when geocoding an address.

* Map needs to reset markers when collection is reset.

* Sometimes the set location loading animation doesn't disappear. (Fixed?)

* Show result count after searching.

* Add typeahead support in search field

* Add search options. Indoor/outdoor, food onsite, basketball hoops, search by name (with typeahead?), ...
* Maybe do it all with tags? Then use a single search field, allowing to search by name or tag.

* Allow to view original size image
* Show more details on the detail page.

* Don't re-render the list or map after showing details. Just hide them and re-show them.
  This should be faster, and make it easier to maintain state.

* Figure out how to show navigation to additional places. About, add playground, login, etc.
* Make an about page.

* Make URL navigation and forward/back work well.
* SEO: slug urls and hashbang stuff for individual playgrounds.

* Add support for comments/ratings
* Allow to add/edit playgrounds
* Allow to upload images. How to integrate w/iPhone?

* Integrate with Facebook
** Like a playground
** Crosspost comments/ratings to timeline
** Login w/Facebook account
** Import friends list

Server
------

* Streamline mapping.
* Pull controllers into separate class.
* See example at https://github.com/yohang/silex-backbone-todolist/blob/master/src/app.php

Set up Assetic? Or maybe use grunt-bbb instead.

Update Chef config
------------------
* Update local config file
* Add environment variable "env" to apache config:   SetEnv env dev
* Add test environment: db and credentials, apache env, local config
