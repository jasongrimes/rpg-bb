Playground site TODOs
=====================

Client
------

* Do something with the header title / back button
* Padding on the details page

* Make search work

* Show full search options on initial page load. Collapse when showing search results.
* Add search options. Indoor/outdoor, food onsite, basketball hoops, search by name (with typeahead?), ...
* Maybe do it all with tags? Then use a single search field, allowing to search by name or tag.
* Default to "near you". Allow to edit location and radius, or disable it.
* Have a show all option.
* Add a "search" button (magnifying glass icon) next to list/map. Make it open the search-list panel, with search form expanded.
  In onecol layout, hide the list when the search form is expanded?
* Refactor the search code. Make search form fire an event that the map view listens on to pin the source position.


* Allow to view original size image

* Make URL navigation and forward/back work well.
* SEO: slug urls and hashbang stuff for individual playgrounds.

* Add support for comments/ratings
* Allow to add/edit playgrounds
* Allow to upload images. How to integrate w/iPhone?

* Integrate with Facebook
** Like a playground
** Crosspost comments/ratings to timeline
** Login w/Facebook account
** Import friends list

Server
------

* Streamline mapping.
* Pull controllers into separate class.
* See example at https://github.com/yohang/silex-backbone-todolist/blob/master/src/app.php

Set up Assetic? Or maybe use grunt-bbb instead.

Update Chef config
------------------
* Update local config file
* Add environment variable "env" to apache config:   SetEnv env dev
* Add test environment: db and credentials, apache env, local config
